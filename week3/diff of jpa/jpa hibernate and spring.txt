1. Java Persistence API (JPA)
JSR 338 Specification for persisting, reading, and managing data from Java objects.
It is just a specification, not an implementation.
Hibernate is one of the popular implementations of JPA.

2. Hibernate
Hibernate is an ORM (Object Relational Mapping) tool.
It implements JPA and also adds its own powerful features (e.g., caching, lazy loading).
Requires more boilerplate code compared to Spring Data JPA.

3. Spring Data JPA
Not a JPA implementation.
Provides a higher-level abstraction over JPA (typically using Hibernate underneath).
Simplifies database access by removing boilerplate code (e.g., no need to write CRUD methods).
Automatically handles transactions with Spring's @Transactional.
Uses JpaRepository, which provides CRUD, pagination, and sorting methods out of the box.
